Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n\nJust like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n\n## ‼️ Please Read\n\n> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.

Imagine a world where your code works smarter, not harder, with intelligent components collaborating to achieve ambitious goals. Welcome to the future of software development: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS).\n\nAt its heart, MAS involves individual, autonomous agents that communicate, coordinate, and cooperate to solve problems. Think of an ant colony where each ant, though simple, contributes to a complex, emergent behavior, or a well-oiled human team where each member has a specific role.\n\nFor developers, MAS offers a powerful toolkit. Its greatest benefit lies in **enhanced modularity and maintainability**. Each agent acts as a self-contained unit, making your codebase easier to manage, update, and debug. Problems are isolated, and changes can be implemented with less risk of unintended consequences.\n\nFurthermore, MAS significantly boosts **robustness and resilience**. If one agent encounters an issue or fails, others can often compensate, preventing a system-wide collapse. This inherent fault tolerance is invaluable for critical applications.\n\nFinally, MAS excels in **scalability and flexibility**. Need to handle more load or add new features? Simply add or remove agents, allowing your system to adapt fluidly to changing demands and functionalities without requiring a complete architectural overhaul.\n\nFrom intricate simulations to intelligent automation, MAS is transforming how we build software.

Imagine a world where your code works smarter, not harder, with intelligent components collaborating to achieve ambitious goals. Welcome to the future of software development: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS).\n\nAt its heart, MAS involves individual, autonomous agents that communicate, coordinate, and cooperate to solve problems. Think of an ant colony where each ant, though simple, contributes to a complex, emergent behavior, or a well-oiled human team where each member has a specific role. These agents, much like individuals in a team, are designed to act independently but work harmoniously towards a common objective.\n\nFor developers, MAS offers a powerful toolkit. Its greatest benefit lies in **enhanced modularity and maintainability**. Each agent acts as a self-contained unit, making your codebase easier to manage, update, and debug. Because problems are isolated within individual agents, changes can be implemented with less risk of unintended consequences across the entire system. This granular control significantly simplifies the development and maintenance lifecycle.\n\nFurthermore, MAS significantly boosts **robustness and resilience**. In traditional monolithic systems, a single point of failure can bring everything down. With MAS, if one agent encounters an issue or fails, others can often compensate for its absence or take over its tasks. This inherent fault tolerance is invaluable for critical applications where downtime is not an option.\n\nFinally, MAS excels in **scalability and flexibility**. As your software's demands grow or evolve, you can effortlessly adapt your system. Need to handle more load or add new features? Simply add or remove agents. This allows your system to adapt fluidly to changing demands and functionalities without requiring a complete architectural overhaul, saving time and resources.\n\nFrom intricate simulations that model complex real-world scenarios to intelligent automation powering everything from smart grids to robotics, MAS is transforming how we build software. By embracing this paradigm, you can unlock new levels of efficiency, resilience, and intelligence in your creations.

However, regulatory challenges persist, with some proposed AI safety bills being diluted due to industry lobbying.\n\n**Health:**\nThe Trump administration has implemented new rules that could deny asylum based on health risks, effective December 31, 2025. Significant policy decisions impacting healthcare are continuing, with potential negative consequences for the poor and disabled. Some states are receiving rural health funding, but concerns remain about its adequacy in offsetting larger budget cuts. Additionally, proposals aim to block access to gender-affirming care for minors, with potential impacts on federal funding for hospitals.\n\n**Finance:**\nNinepoint Partners and Hamilton ETFs have announced their final 2025 cash and non-cash distributions. While 2025 saw positive government initiatives like GST and income tax slab changes, market performance was largely sideways, highlighting the need for demand to drive growth. Investors are advised to focus on diversification into small-cap and international stocks due to high valuations in large-cap US companies. The market outlook for 2026 includes potential volatility, with a focus on disciplined, long-term investment strategies rather than market timing.\nAggregatorAgent > ## Executive Summary: Converging Trends in Technology, Health, and Finance\n\n**Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the dominant, unifying force across all sectors.** Generative AI's expansion into content creation, coupled with **agentic AI** enabling autonomous workflows, is driving significant productivity gains and cost reductions in business. This AI revolution is also profoundly impacting healthcare, with **AI-driven diagnostics** poised for widespread clinical integration within 3-5 years and **AI-powered financial services** set to transform personalized planning and risk assessment within the same timeframe.\n\nSurprising connections emerge as **agentic AI** shows potential for complex problem-solving in fields like drug discovery, underscoring its broad applicability. While **CRISPR gene editing** and **mRNA vaccine technology** promise major health breakthroughs in the next 5-10 years, the immediate impact of AI in healthcare and finance is more rapid. In finance, **embedded finance** and **DeFi** are maturing, but the ongoing development and integration of AI are paramount for future growth and investor strategy. Regulatory landscapes are also evolving, with AI safety bills facing industry lobbying, and health policy decisions raising concerns about equitable access.\n\nThe key takeaway is the accelerating pace of AI-driven innovation, demanding strategic adaptation for businesses and policymakers alike to harness its transformative potential while navigating its complex implications.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":19},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"🎉 Great! You've seen how parallel agents can dramatically speed up workflows by running independent tasks concurrently.\n\nSo far, all our workflows run from start to finish and then stop. **But what if you need to review and improve an output multiple times?** Next, we'll build a workflow that can loop and refine its own work.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n## ➰ Section 5: Loop Workflows - The Refinement Cycle\n\n**The Problem: One-Shot Quality**\n\nAll the workflows we've seen so far run from start to finish. The `SequentialAgent` and `ParallelAgent` produce their final output and then stop. This 'one-shot' approach isn't good for tasks that require refinement and quality control. What if the first draft of our story is bad? We have no way to review it and ask for a rewrite.\n\n**The Solution: Iterative Refinement**\n\nWhen a task needs to be improved through cycles of feedback and revision, you can use a `LoopAgent`. A `LoopAgent` runs a set of sub-agents repeatedly *until a specific condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.* This creates a refinement cycle, allowing the agent system to improve its own work over and over.\n\n**Use Loop when:** Iterative improvement is needed, quality refinement matters, or you need repeated cycles.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [loop agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Story Writing & Critique Loop**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"Initial Prompt\"] -- > B[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    B -- >|story| C[\"Critic Agent\"]\n    C -- >|critique| D{\"Iteration < Max<br>AND<br>Not Approved?\"}\n    D -- >|Yes| B\n    D -- >|No| E[\"Final Story\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style C fill:#ffcccc\n    style D fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"250\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/loop-agent.png\" alt=\"Loop Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5.1 Example: Iterative Story Refinement\n\nLet's build a system with two agents:\n\n1. **Writer Agent** - Writes a draft of a short story\n2. **Critic Agent** - Reviews and critiques the short story to suggest improvements","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent runs ONCE at the beginning to create the first draft.\ninitial_writer_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"InitialWriterAgent\",\n    model=Gemini(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n        retry_options=retry_config\n    ),\n    instruction=\"\"\"Based on the user's prompt, write the first draft of a short story (around 100-150 words).\n    Output only the story text, with no introduction or explanation.\"\"\",\n    output_key=\"current_story\",  # Stores the first draft in the state.\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\")","metadata":{"id":"a2b8WlJoBtHF","outputId":"13ed1e15-dcf9-4e1d-ad1e-fb18ee793de5","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-12-31T03:17:51.952967Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-12-31T03:17:51.953815Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-12-31T03:17:51.958968Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-12-31T03:17:51.953787Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-12-31T03:17:51.958067Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":20},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent's only job is to provide feedback or the approval signal.

Here are a few suggestions for improvement:\n\n1.  **Show, Don't Just Tell Elias's Isolation:** While you mention his thirty years as a companion to the beam, consider adding a small detail or action that *demonstrates* his isolation more vividly. For example, does he talk to himself? Does he meticulously polish the same object daily? This would make the impact of the map discovery even greater.\n2.  **Enhance the \"Unearthly Luminescence\":** The description of the map is good, but the \"unearthly luminescence\" could be elaborated upon. What kind of glow is it? Does it cast shadows? Does it change intensity? Adding a sensory detail beyond just \"soft blue light\" would deepen the mystery and magic of the object.\n3.  **Foreshadow the \"World Beyond\":** The last sentence hints at a world beyond. To make this more impactful, you could subtly foreshadow this earlier. Perhaps Elias has always felt a pull towards the unknown, or maybe he’s seen peculiar things on the horizon that he’s dismissed. This would give his reaction to the map more emotional weight.\nRefinerAgent > Elias traced the salt-worn grooves of his desk, a familiar ritual in the quiet hum of the lighthouse. For thirty years, the rhythmic sweep of his beam had been his only companion, slicing through the inky blackness beyond the tower’s thick glass. He’d taken to talking to the gulls, his voice a low rumble that barely disturbed the settled dust, and his days were marked by the meticulous polishing of the brass fixtures, each gleam a small defiance against the encroaching loneliness. Tonight, however, something was different. Tucked beneath a stack of old logbooks, a rolled parchment shimmered, catching the lamplight in an unusual way.\n\nUnfurling it, Elias’s breath hitched. It wasn’t paper, but something like dried seaweed, yet it pulsed with an internal, soft blue light that seemed to breathe. The luminescence wasn't steady; it brightened and dimmed subtly, casting dancing, elongated shadows on the worn wood of his desk. Intricate lines, like constellations mirroring the night sky, swirled across its surface, forming an unknown coastline. Strange symbols, neither English nor any language he knew, marked a spot near a jagged, sketched island. A chill, not of the sea air, prickled his skin. He’d always felt a strange pull towards the distant, hazy horizon, a yearning for something more than the predictable tides and lonely nights, a feeling he’d always dismissed as sea-madness.

You're Now an Agent Orchestrator\n\nIn this notebook, you made the leap from a single agent to a **multi-agent system**.\n\nYou saw **why** a team of specialists is easier to build and debug than one \"do-it-all\" agent. Most importantly, you learned how to be the **director** of that team.\n\nYou used `SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, and `LoopAgent` to create deterministic workflows, and you even used an LLM as a 'manager' to make dynamic decisions. You also mastered the \"plumbing\" by using `output_key` to pass state between agents and make them collaborative.\n\n**ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n\nThis notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.\n\n### 📚 Learn More\n\nRefer to the following documentation to learn more:\n\n- [Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/)\n- [Sequential Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/sequential-agents/)\n- [Parallel Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/parallel-agents/)\n- [Loop Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/)\n- [Custom Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/custom-agents/)\n\n### 🎯 Next Steps\n\nReady for the next challenge?
