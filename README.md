# 🤖 AI Agents Intensive Course – Google × Kaggle

## Overview
This repository contains my hands-on work and notes from the **5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google**, delivered through Kaggle Learn. The course is a practical, end-to-end program focused on designing, building, evaluating, and deploying AI agents using modern agentic architectures.

## What This Course Covers
The course explores the full lifecycle of AI agents, including:

- Foundations of AI agents and agentic architectures  
- Tool usage and interoperability using **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**  
- Context engineering with sessions and long-term memory  
- Agent quality, observability, logging, tracing, and evaluation  
- Moving from prototypes to production-ready, scalable **multi-agent systems** using the **Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol**

## Course Structure

### Day 1 – Introduction to Agents
Foundational concepts of AI agents, agent capabilities, and how agentic systems differ from traditional LLM-based applications.

### Day 2 – Agent Tools & Interoperability (MCP)
Designing and integrating tools that allow agents to take actions, retrieve real-time data, and interoperate using MCP.

### Day 3 – Context Engineering: Sessions & Memory
Building stateful agents with short-term and long-term memory to support coherent, multi-turn interactions.

### Day 4 – Agent Quality
Evaluating and improving agent reliability using observability, logs, traces, metrics, and evaluation strategies.

### Day 5 – Prototype to Production
Deploying and scaling agents for real-world use, including building multi-agent systems using the A2A Protocol.

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebooks  
- Kaggle Notebooks  
- Gemini (via Agent Development Kit)
